# Useful Scripts

## Overview

Just a collection of semi-useful scripts I've written that have helped me in one way or another which I've then neatened up, added a few more options and attempted to make them presentable to the world. Also useful to showcase scripting skills. Scripts to be added periodically as free time allows.

I do my best to make my scripts as lean as possible and avoid repetition wherever possible. I also try to structure my code in a consistent fashion, indented with comments to clearly show a new section of code.

I'm familiar with the following scripting languages: **BASH/Shell, PHP, Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript (inc. AJAX & JQuery), SQL, YAML, AWK, sed, JSON, Actionscript**

> A previous version of this script used PHP to populate the page with data but this required many more server dependencies in order to view the webpage. Converting everything to Javascript allowed a static HTML page to be used instead.
